## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

My first time attempting something with Grid! Quite pleased with the turn out, but I reverted back to flex for the mobile view.
First I made the container and I layed out the boxes inside with the respective colours, then I addded the content to the first one, styled it.
When the first was complete I just copied and pasted and changed the texted (and added a class for the dark text) and they all literally fell in to place with a nice clunk.
